# Milestone 11 - Display Products Dynamically

## Overview 📌

In this milestone, we made the home page dynamic by fetching product data from MongoDB and displaying it using the **Product Card** component.

## What We Did 🔧

### 1️⃣ Backend - Created an API Endpoint

- We wrote an endpoint `/getProducts` in the backend to fetch all product data from MongoDB.
- The endpoint retrieves product details, including name, description, price, category, and image URLs stored in the database.

### 2️⃣ Storing Product Images

- Images uploaded from the frontend are stored in the `uploads/` folder in the backend.
- Only the image file path is stored in MongoDB.
- We used `multer` for handling file uploads.

### 3️⃣ Frontend - Fetching Data

- We created a function in `ProductCardList` to fetch data from the backend using `fetch("https://ecommerce-zof6.onrender.com/getProducts")`.
- The response is stored in the `products` state using `useState()`.

### 4️⃣ Displaying Products Dynamically

- The fetched product data is mapped and passed to the **Product Card** component.
- The image source is set dynamically using `product.images[0]` (assuming the first image).
- The UI now updates automatically when new products are added to the database.

# Milestone 12: Dynamic Product Display

### Overview

In this milestone, we have successfully implemented the feature to dynamically display products on the frontend based on the stored data in the backend.

### Changes Implemented:

1. **Server-Side Enhancements:**

   - Created a new API endpoint (`/getProducts`) to fetch all products from the database.
   - Used `Product.find()` to retrieve stored product details.
   - Handled errors to ensure smooth API responses.

2. **Client-Side Modifications:**
   - Updated `ProductCardList` component to fetch product data from the backend.
   - Used `useEffect` to make an API call and store the retrieved data in state (`setProducts`).
   - Displayed products dynamically based on the fetched data.

### Code Summary:

#### **Backend (`server/routes/productRoutes.js`)**

```js
const express = require("express");
const {
  createProduct,
  uploadImages,
  getProducts,
} = require("../controllers/productController");
const router = express.Router();

router.post("/createProduct", uploadImages, createProduct);
router.get("/getProducts", getProducts);

module.exports = router;
```

- Developing a **backend endpoint** to update product details in MongoDB.
- Handling navigation between the product list and the edit form.

---

## 📌 Learning Goals

By the end of this milestone, you will understand:

- How to create an **update endpoint** in Express.js for modifying database entries.
- How to **pre-fill form fields** with existing data for a seamless editing experience.
- How to **send updated product data** from the frontend to the backend and update MongoDB.

---

## 🏗 Steps Implemented

### 1️⃣ Backend: Create the Update Endpoint

We added an endpoint to **fetch a single product** and another to **update product details** in MongoDB.

#### ✅ **Fetch a Single Product**

```javascript
app.get("/getProduct/:id", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const product = await Product.findById(req.params.id);
    if (!product) {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: "Product not found" });
    }
    res.json(product);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Error fetching product" });
  }
});
```

  - Navigates to `/order-success` after order placement with a 5-second delay.

## **2️⃣ Backend Setup**

- ✅ **No Changes**: Leveraged existing `/getUserByEmail` and `/api/v1/orders/create` endpoints for order placement.

## **3️⃣ Key Achievements**

- Implemented PayPal payment integration for online payments in the sandbox environment.
- Enabled COD and Online Payment options with seamless order placement.

# **Milestone 31: Progress Summary**

## **1️⃣ Frontend Setup**

- ✅ **Redux Installation**: Installed the `react-redux` npm package for global state management.
- ✅ **Store Folder Creation**: Created a `store` folder in the `client` directory with `store.js` and `userActions.js` files.
- ✅ **Global State Configuration**: Configured a Redux store in `store.js` with a `userReducer` to manage the user’s email state.
- ✅ **Action Creator**: Defined a `setEmail` function in `userActions.js` to update the email in the global state.
- ✅ **Provider Integration**: Wrapped the `App` component with the `Provider` component in `main.jsx`, passing the store as a prop.

## **2️⃣ Backend Setup**

- ✅ **No Changes**: Leveraged existing frontend structure without backend modifications.

## **3️⃣ Key Achievements**

- Successfully set up Redux to manage the user’s email as a global state, accessible across components like `OrderConfirmation`, `PaymentOptions`, and `MyOrders`.
- Established a foundation for centralized state management in the e-commerce application.

# **Milestone 32: Progress Summary**

## **1️⃣ Frontend Setup**

- ✅ **Dispatch Email in Login**: Updated the `Login` page to use `useDispatch` from `react-redux` to dispatch the `setEmail` action, storing the user’s email in the global state after a successful login.
- ✅ **Access Email with useSelector**: Modified `OrderConfirmation`, `PaymentOptions`, and `MyOrders` pages to access the user’s email from the Redux store using `useSelector`, replacing previous methods (`localStorage`, URL params, or navigation state).
- ✅ **Removed Redundant Email Storage**: Removed `localStorage` usage for storing the email in `Login` and other pages, relying entirely on Redux for email management.

## **2️⃣ Backend Setup**

- ✅ **No Changes**: Leveraged existing endpoints (`/login`, `/getCart`, `/getUserByEmail`, `/api/v1/orders/create`) without modifications.

## **3️⃣ Key Achievements**

- Successfully used Redux to store and access the user’s email across the application, ensuring consistent state management.
- Eliminated dependency on `localStorage` and URL params for email access, improving security and maintainability.

# **Milestone 32: Progress Summary**

## **1️⃣ Frontend Setup**

- ✅ **Dispatch Email in Login**: Updated the `Login` page to use `useDispatch` to dispatch the `setEmail` action, storing the user’s email in the Redux global state upon successful login.
- ✅ **Access Email with useSelector**: Modified pages to retrieve the email from the Redux store using `useSelector`:
  - Updated `OrderConfirmation` to replace `searchParams.get("userEmail")` with `useSelector((state) => state.user.email)`, adding a redirect to `/login` if the email is `null`.
  - Ensured `PaymentOptions` and `MyOrders` (previously updated) also use `useSelector` for email access.
- ✅ **Removed Redundant Storage**: Eliminated `localStorage` usage for email in `Login` and replaced it with Redux, retaining `localStorage` for the token.

## **2️⃣ Backend Setup**

- ✅ **No Changes**: Continued using existing endpoints (`/login`, `/getCart`, `/getUserByEmail`, `/api/v1/orders/create`) without modifications.

## **3️⃣ Key Achievements**

- Successfully implemented Redux to manage and access the user’s email across the application, enhancing state consistency.
- Added authentication checks in `OrderConfirmation` to redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.
- Improved security and maintainability by centralizing email management in Redux.

# **Milestone 33: Progress Summary**

## **1️⃣ Frontend Setup**

- ✅ **Updated Login Page**: Modified `Login.jsx` to remove `localStorage.setItem` for both `userEmail` and `token`, relying on Redux (`setEmail`) and the backend-sent cookie (`authToken`).
- ✅ **No Additional Changes**: Ensured compatibility with the new backend cookie-based authentication.

## **2️⃣ Backend Setup**

- ✅ **Installed jsonwebtoken**: Added the `jsonwebtoken` package to the server using NPM.
- ✅ **JWT Token Creation**: Updated `loginUser` in `userController.js` to use `jwt.sign` to create a token with `email` and `_id`, signed with `process.env.JWT_SECRET` or a fallback secret.
- ✅ **Set Expiration Time**: Configured the token with `expiresIn: "1h"` and set `maxAge: 3600000` (1 hour) for the cookie.
- ✅ **Added Cookie to Response**: Implemented `res.cookie` to send the `authToken` with `httpOnly`, `secure` (in production), and `sameSite: "strict"` options for security.

## **3️⃣ Key Achievements**

- Successfully implemented JWT-based authentication, storing the token securely as a cookie instead of `localStorage`.
- Centralized email management in Redux, removing redundant `localStorage` usage.
- Enhanced security with `httpOnly` cookies to prevent client-side access.
