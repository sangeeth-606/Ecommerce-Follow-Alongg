- _Deployment_: GitHub Pages (frontend) and Render/Heroku (backend)
- _Additional Tools_: Postman for API testing, JWT for authentication, and bcrypt for password hashing.

## Why This Project

I chose this project because it provides an opportunity to practice and demonstrate a wide range of development skills, including frontend and backend development, database schema design, and secure authentication. Building an e-commerce platform is both challenging and rewarding, as it allows me to explore real-world scenarios and enhance my ability to create scalable web applications.

## Milestone 2:

Implemented a user login page with username and password fields. Styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design. Validates input and handles user authentication upon form submission.

## Milestone 3: Server Setup

Set up the server with express for HTTP requests and mongoose for MongoDB. Configured routing and database connections, providing endpoints for user authentication and other functionalities.

## Milestone 4: User Model, Controller, and File Upload

In this milestone, we added user management and file upload functionality:

### Key Points:

1. **User Model**: Created a `User` model for storing user data (name, email, password) in the database.
2. **User Controller**: Built a controller for handling user-related requests (adding and retrieving users).
3. **File Upload**: Integrated **Multer** to handle file uploads, allowing users to upload images to the `uploads/` directory.
4. **Server Updates**: Enhanced `server.js` to support user routes and file upload functionality.
5. **Testing**: Verified file upload using **Postman**, with successful uploads stored in the `uploads/` folder.

# Milestone 5: Building the Sign-Up Page 🌟

## Overview

In this milestone, we focused on creating the **Sign-Up Page** for our application, implementing **form validation**, and adding **routing/navigation** to ensure a smooth and user-friendly registration experience. This milestone is a crucial step in building a functional frontend for user onboarding and improving app navigation.

     - **Login** button to navigate users to the Login Page.
   - Implemented routing using `useNavigate` from `react-router-dom` to handle page navigation and improve the user experience.

# Milestone 6: Backend API for Signup

## What Was Achieved

1. **Password Encryption**:

   - Used `bcrypt` to hash passwords during the signup process.
   - Stored hashed passwords securely in the database instead of plain text.

2. **User Data Storage**:

   - Saved complete user data, including name, email, and other details, in the database.
   - Ensured sensitive data, like passwords, remained encrypted.

3. **CORS Configuration**:
   - Implemented `cors` to enable secure cross-origin requests for the API.

These steps enhanced the security and functionality of the signup process while ensuring compatibility with frontend requests.

# Milestone 7: User Authentication

## Overview

In this milestone, we focused on implementing user authentication, including user signup and login functionality. We ensured secure password handling and JWT-based authentication for session management.

   - Sent JWT tokens to the client upon successful login.

3. **Error Handling**:

   - Implemented comprehensive error handling for both signup and login processes.
   - Returned appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for different scenarios (e.g., user already exists, invalid password, user not found).

4. **Testing with Postman**:

   - Verified the functionality of the `createUser` and `loginUser` endpoints using Postman.
   - Ensured that the endpoints return the expected responses and handle errors correctly.

5. **Code Refactoring**:

# Milestone 8: Product Card Component and (styles with gpt)

## Overview

Milestone 8 focuses on designing a reusable product card component and creating a responsive homepage layout to showcase these cards. The aim was to build an organised, visually appealing, and user-friendly interface for displaying product details.

## Achievements 🎯

### 1. Reusable Product Card Component
- Developed a flexible product card component using props to display dynamic product details.
- Each card includes key information such as:
  - **Product Image**: A visually clear representation of the product.
  - **Name**: The product's title.
  - **Price**: The cost displayed prominently.
  - **Description**: A brief overview of the product.

### 2. Responsive Grid Layout
- Designed a homepage layout using Tailwind CSS to arrange product cards in a neat, grid-based structure.
- Ensured responsiveness for an optimal viewing experience across various devices:
  - **Small screens**: Displays cards in a single column.
  - **Medium screens (768px and above)**: Displays cards in two columns.
  - **Large screens (1024px and above)**: Displays cards in four columns.

## Learning Goals 🌟

By completing this milestone, the following objectives were achieved:
- Understanding how to create and style reusable components in frontend development.

  - **Images**: File input for uploading product images.

### 2. State Management
- Utilized React's `useState` hook to manage form data.
- Implemented dynamic state updates using computed property names:
  ```jsx
  const handleInputChange = (e) => {
    setProductData({ ...productData, [e.target.name]: e.target.value });
  };
# Milestone 10: Product Schema and Endpoint Creation 🚀

### Learning Goals 🎯

# Milestone 11 - Display Products Dynamically  

## Overview 📌  
In this milestone, we made the home page dynamic by fetching product data from MongoDB and displaying it using the **Product Card** component.  

## What We Did 🔧  

### 1️⃣ Backend - Created an API Endpoint  
- We wrote an endpoint `/getProducts` in the backend to fetch all product data from MongoDB.  
- The endpoint retrieves product details, including name, description, price, category, and image URLs stored in the database.  

### 2️⃣ Storing Product Images  
- Images uploaded from the frontend are stored in the `uploads/` folder in the backend.  
- Only the image file path is stored in MongoDB.  
- We used `multer` for handling file uploads.  

### 3️⃣ Frontend - Fetching Data  
- We created a function in `ProductCardList` to fetch data from the backend using `fetch("http://localhost:8080/getProducts")`.  
- The response is stored in the `products` state using `useState()`.  

### 4️⃣ Displaying Products Dynamically  
- The fetched product data is mapped and passed to the **Product Card** component.  
- The image source is set dynamically using `product.images[0]` (assuming the first image).  
- The UI now updates automatically when new products are added to the database.  

# Milestone 12: Dynamic Product Display

### Overview
In this milestone, we have successfully implemented the feature to dynamically display products on the frontend based on the stored data in the backend.

### Changes Implemented:
1. **Server-Side Enhancements:**
   - Created a new API endpoint (`/getProducts`) to fetch all products from the database.
   - Used `Product.find()` to retrieve stored product details.
   - Handled errors to ensure smooth API responses.

2. **Client-Side Modifications:**
   - Updated `ProductCardList` component to fetch product data from the backend.
   - Used `useEffect` to make an API call and store the retrieved data in state (`setProducts`).
   - Displayed products dynamically based on the fetched data.

### Code Summary:

#### **Backend (`server/routes/productRoutes.js`)**
```js
const express = require('express');
const { createProduct, uploadImages, getProducts } = require('../controllers/productController'); 
const router = express.Router();

router.post('/createProduct', uploadImages, createProduct); 
router.get("/getProducts", getProducts);

module.exports = router;
```
