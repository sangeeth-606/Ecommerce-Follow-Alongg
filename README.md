# Milestone 11 - Display Products Dynamically

## Overview 📌

In this milestone, we made the home page dynamic by fetching product data from MongoDB and displaying it using the **Product Card** component.

## What We Did 🔧

### 1️⃣ Backend - Created an API Endpoint

- We wrote an endpoint `/getProducts` in the backend to fetch all product data from MongoDB.
- The endpoint retrieves product details, including name, description, price, category, and image URLs stored in the database.

### 2️⃣ Storing Product Images

- Images uploaded from the frontend are stored in the `uploads/` folder in the backend.
- Only the image file path is stored in MongoDB.
- We used `multer` for handling file uploads.

### 3️⃣ Frontend - Fetching Data

- We created a function in `ProductCardList` to fetch data from the backend using `fetch("https://ecommerce-zof6.onrender.com/getProducts")`.
- The response is stored in the `products` state using `useState()`.

### 4️⃣ Displaying Products Dynamically

- The fetched product data is mapped and passed to the **Product Card** component.
- The image source is set dynamically using `product.images[0]` (assuming the first image).
- The UI now updates automatically when new products are added to the database.

# Milestone 12: Dynamic Product Display

### Overview

In this milestone, we have successfully implemented the feature to dynamically display products on the frontend based on the stored data in the backend.

### Changes Implemented:

1. **Server-Side Enhancements:**

   - Created a new API endpoint (`/getProducts`) to fetch all products from the database.
   - Used `Product.find()` to retrieve stored product details.
   - Handled errors to ensure smooth API responses.

2. **Client-Side Modifications:**
   - Updated `ProductCardList` component to fetch product data from the backend.
   - Used `useEffect` to make an API call and store the retrieved data in state (`setProducts`).
   - Displayed products dynamically based on the fetched data.

### Code Summary:

#### **Backend (`server/routes/productRoutes.js`)**

```js
const express = require("express");
const {
  createProduct,
  uploadImages,
  getProducts,
} = require("../controllers/productController");
const router = express.Router();

router.post("/createProduct", uploadImages, createProduct);
router.get("/getProducts", getProducts);

module.exports = router;
```

- Developing a **backend endpoint** to update product details in MongoDB.
- Handling navigation between the product list and the edit form.

---

## 📌 Learning Goals

By the end of this milestone, you will understand:

- How to create an **update endpoint** in Express.js for modifying database entries.
- How to **pre-fill form fields** with existing data for a seamless editing experience.
- How to **send updated product data** from the frontend to the backend and update MongoDB.

---

## 🏗 Steps Implemented

### 1️⃣ Backend: Create the Update Endpoint

We added an endpoint to **fetch a single product** and another to **update product details** in MongoDB.

#### ✅ **Fetch a Single Product**

```javascript
app.get("/getProduct/:id", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const product = await Product.findById(req.params.id);
    if (!product) {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: "Product not found" });
    }
    res.json(product);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Error fetching product" });
  }
});
```
